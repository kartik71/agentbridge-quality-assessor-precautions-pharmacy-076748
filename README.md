## 🔧 Workflow Steps


### 1. Case Intake
Collect, validate and normalize care plans from CPOE; attach a runId and timestamp for traceability.

### 2. Delegate
Execute delegate phase for the Multi-Agent pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 3. Handoff
Execute handoff phase for the Multi-Agent pattern: persist interim state, enforce guardrails, and emit structured JSON results.

### 4. Monitoring
Monitoring across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 5. Eligibility Match
Eligibility Match across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 6. Normalization
Normalization across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 7. Documentation
Documentation across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 8. Intervention
Intervention across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 9. Optimization
Optimization across joined datasets; branch on thresholds using decision gates; write metrics (success/error counts) for observability.

### 10. Compliance Report
Assemble final payload with status, artifacts, KPIs and audit trail; store to CPOE; return response JSON for the client.
